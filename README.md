# 100DaysofCoding-Day12-NumberGuessingGame

This game was particulary easy and happened to be one I had done sometime in the past. I attempted to make things a little bit easier by defining the main functionality of the program into a function and allowing the levels to be added without having to retype anything. I also added recursion to allow the user to replay the game if they wanted to.
